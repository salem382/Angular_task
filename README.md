# Angular Form with Undo/Redo Functionality

This project demonstrates an implementation of undo/redo functionality for an Angular form using reactive forms. It allows users to make changes to form fields and undo/redo these changes while preserving form state history.

## Features
- Undo: Reverts the form to its previous state
- Redo: Restores the form to a state that was undone.
- Form Fields: Name, Email, Gender, and an "Agree to terms" checkbox.
